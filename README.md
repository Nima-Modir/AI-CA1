# Use classical search algorithms such as BFS, IDS, A*, and Weighted A* to find the shortest path in a graph.

## Problem Description:
The task is to implement and compare the performance of different search algorithms on a given graph.
### Graph Input:
The input is provided as a text file where the first line specifies the number of nodes and edges. Each subsequent line provides an edge between two nodes.
### Algorithms to Implement:
**BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: A standard search algorithm exploring nodes level by level.

**IDS (Iterative Deepening Search)**: Combines the benefits of DFS with the completeness of BFS by incrementally deepening the search.

**A***: A heuristic-based search algorithm that ensures optimal pathfinding by using cost and heuristic functions.

**Weighted A***: A variation of A* that incorporates a weight factor to balance between optimality and efficiency.

The results are to be evaluated and compared based on metrics like the number of nodes expanded and the total path cost.
